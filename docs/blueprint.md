## Style Guidelines:

- The color palette should be based on a minimalist aesthetic. The background color is a light gray (#F0F0F0), suggesting cleanliness and neutrality, ensuring that the content is the focus. 
- A primary color of dark blue (#34495E) provides a sense of professionalism and trustworthiness. The choice to veer away from teal helps to convey a feeling of distinctiveness. 
- For highlights and calls to action, an analogous accent color of slightly lighter blue (#5DADE2) can be used to draw attention without disrupting the overall harmony. This provides visual interest while still being professional and approachable.
- Clean and readable sans-serif font for body text to ensure readability.
- Use a clean, grid-based layout to present the portfolio in an organized and visually appealing manner.
